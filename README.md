## Project Structure🚀
The project consists of the following files:
  - **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
  - **styles.css:** The CSS file for styling the game elements.
  - **script.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## GamePlay Mechanics
  - **Sequence Generation:** The game randomly selects one of the four boxes to flash in each round. The sequence of flashed boxes is stored and extended in each round.
  - **User Input:** Users must click the boxes in the exact sequence as they flashed. The game checks the user input against the stored sequence.
  - **Feedback:** The game provides visual feedback by flashing the body red to indicate the user entered the wrong sequence and displays the current score with a game over message when applicable.
